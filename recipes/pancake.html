    <p>A classic recipe for breakfast. If you eat one of these you will start your day full of energy.</p>
    <p>It's an easy to do recipe. You can make as much as you want of these and save them on the freezer for future days.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 cup of flaked oats</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cup of milk</li>
      <li>1 egg</li>
      <li>1 banana</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon of liquid vanilla essence</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>I usually buy instant flaked oats, so you will have to soak it for at least 12 hours on the fridge to activate it. It's not mandatory, but recommended.</li>
      <li>Cut the banana in small pieces to mix with the other ingredients, or better use a potato smasher.</li>
      <li>Mix all the ingredients in a bowl. You can also put them in a mixer or a blender to shred them better.</li>
      <li>Turn on a stove</li>
      <li>Fill a skillet with a small amount of the mixture and cook it for 2 to 4 minutes until golden</li>
      <li>Flip the pancakes and wait for other 2 minutes and they are ready!!!</li>
    </ol>
